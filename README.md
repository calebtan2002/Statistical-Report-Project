# Statistical Report Project
## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my final assignment for the DSA1101 module. It focuses on employing various machine learning models to analyze a dataset consisting of 70,692 survey responses collected in the United States in 2015. The primary objective is to predict diabetes status among individuals using models such as k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. The analysis is conducted using R, and the project aims to evaluate and identify the most effective model in terms of prediction accuracy.
